OH YES. things happen after google has charged you the $3 for your click. Now it's time to show the customer that's COST YOU MONEY, how to give you MORE money back.

What are the tricks you can use to convince the customer to buy from you.

How can you convince your customer that the page he or she is looking at is specifically designed for them. 

What can you do on your store to get more SHOPPERS and less LOOKERS.

If you're offering an Affiliate product... How do you convince them to buy the product you're trying to promote? And how can you drop the "affiliate cookie" so you'll get the credit EVEN if they buy from someone else.

How do you convince them to buy from you, and to stop looking after they clicked on you.
