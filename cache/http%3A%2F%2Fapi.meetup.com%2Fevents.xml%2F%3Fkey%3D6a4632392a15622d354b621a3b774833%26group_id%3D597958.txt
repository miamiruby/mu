During a recession, public money and private foundation grants become more competitive. Artists who work with non-profit organizations, or who count on them as clients, need to become savvy if they hope to have their projects funded. Take some crucial tips from a grant panelist and learn from the mistakes others have made. Two mock proposals will be discussed.

[i]"Participants in this meeting in October get a free CD-Rom with Resources for the Artist Entrepreneur. Developed in conjunction with visual artists and performers, this kit meets the needs for all artists starting a business."[/i]

Because of the extent of the material presented, participants must RSVP in advance.
