Hey guys and gals...

I'm in the National Film Challenge. If you haven't heard of it, you can read more about it at http://www.filmchallenge.org/

I'm looking for a few aspiring actors and actresses for the shoot. Basically the national film challenge is like the 48 hour film challenge where you have a weekend to write, shoot and edit a short film.

We will be meeting friday night for some pizza to brainstorm ideas for the short film. Then Saturday we will shoot all the scenes and sunday I will edit, add special effects and music to the film (to be mailed out Monday morning - per contest guidelines).

You don not need experience acting... just a desire to act, the ability to follow directions and most importantly be reliable.

By signing up yes, you are showing interest in this project and will be contacted by me to determine what potential character types you could play. Speak about any experience you may have and go over your availability. Depending on the script we write on Friday will determine how many actors/actresses we need... so by signing up yes this does not guarantee you a spot. However, the sooner we talk, the better your chances.

Lastly, this is not a paid acting position, however, if we win or place high in the contest we will receive national distribution and some film screenings. You will have to sign a participation waiver to be in the film.

If you have any questions, please shoot me a message!
Ciao,

We are planning our Epic Fantasy Fest Event at this time. You know people still talk about our 2007 Fantasy Fest Event ( especially the bus ride down) We have developed awesome relationships and created lifelong memories with people. In fact, there were a few that it was their first Meetup (now that's bravery)!!

Now is the time to get onboard and prepare to walk the plank!

[img]http://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k240/meghan_dancho/Fantasy%20Fest/P1010042.jpg[/img]

For reasons a plenty we have decided to simplify the process and take the bus down to Fantasy Fest. We will have the same type of bus and the festivities will abound.

[b]The bus ride:[/b]
Last year we were able to take 55 meetup members from Tri-County Travel and SFYA. The bus left at 1:00pm on Saturday and dropped us off at 5pm on Duval street. We spent the day and night drinking our arses off and then boarded the bus at 3:00am for the ride back home.

By popular demand, this year we are doing it again... if it ain't broke why fix it?!

This year we will have a 2:00 PM departure and will meet at 1:30 PM for check-in's. 

[b]Pick-up location:[/b] 
Sheridan Street Tri-Rail Station
2900 Sheridan Street 
Hollywood, FL  33021

 

[b]Directions[/b]
I-95 to Sheridan Street, exit #21. West on Sheridan Street to North 29th Avenue (first traffic light). Turn left onto 29th Avenue and make immediate right into Station.

[color=red][b]NOTE:[/b][/color] Although overnight parking is permitted, parking is at your own risk.



[b][color=red]Payments:[/color][/b]
Payments will be accepted by [b]PayPal Invoice[/b] ONLY!! [b][u]DO NOT[/u][/b] go to paypal directly and pay if you have not been invoiced. Since seating is limited invoicing will be our tracking method and seat count.

COST: $55.00 per person (now booking second bus only)

[b]Steps:[/b]
[list=1]

[/list=1]


[b]**ALL EMAILS REQUESTING A SEAT WILL BE RESPONDED TO ON A FIRST COME FIRST SERVE BASIS**[/b]

[color=red][b]NOTE:[/b] 
Invoice MUST be paid in full  within 72 hours in order to guarantee your seating and avoid cancellation. Invoice alone does not confirm your seat.[/color]

[b]Refunds:[/b]
There are NO refunds... NO exceptions.

***If you have purchased a seat but cannot attend, you can sell your seat to another person so long as you provide Barbarella with the name of the person taking your place. Your name [b]MUST[/b] be on the check-in list in order to board the bus.

[img]http://i71.photobucket.com/albums/i124/kapusiv/halloween1.gif[/img]

[b][color=darkred]AMAZING SFYA DEAL:

- The club normally opens at 10pm. They will be opening at 9pm, an entire hour early, JUST for our group. WOW
- For a $10 cover charge at the door(a $10 savings over the regular $20 cover charge everyone else will be paying for Halloween), we will be getting:[/color]
[b]OPEN BAR ON ALL WELL, CALL AND BEER DRINKS from 9-10pm. 
From 10pm-1am the venue is offering us $5 U-call-it drinks.

Best of all, there is a back room at the end of the main room which will be made PRIVATE to our group only until 1a.m. This means you will need our special wristband to be in this area. 
This is what I call some serious VIP treatment.[/b][/b]

**SO plan your night accordingly, get dressed in your funnest/hottest costumes and join us for a screamy, scary Halloween party.  **

"The Voodoo Lounge, Ft. Lauderdale's newest upscale nightclub is located at 111 S.W. 2nd Ave. (Moffat St.) in the same building that once housed the infamous Independence Brewery. Opening on March 2nd of 2000 to a record crowd, The Voodoo Lounge has been going strong for over 8 years now and shows no signs of stopping. With nearly 10,000 square feet of space, it is without a doubt one of Ft. Lauderdale's largest nightclubs"

Year after year, approximately 65,000 spectators continue to be in awe of the creations that are formed simply by combining water and the sugar fine white sand from our spectacular beach. Many of the Masters believe that [url=http://www.sandfestival.com/]Fort Myers Beach[/url] sand is the best in the world for events like this, and they look forward to returning each year to participate.

Fordee has held a few of these in the past and I thought they'd be a great idea to start up again, now that I have my own place with some room ha ha. However, there are a few rules, so please read the following points.

[b]REQUIREMENT'S:[/b]
1) You must bring a home-cooked dish. If you come with something store bought you will not gain admittance to the soiree. Home-cooked does not mean you have to cook yourself, a friend, a family member, a hire-chef can cook it... but don't bring store brought stuff. The fun in the event is trying everyone's culinary talents.

2) Please bring some type of beverage. If you drink alcohol bring alcohol. If you drink soda, bring soda. Water will be provided along with some type of non-alcoholic drink, but I encourage you to bring your favorite beverage.

3) No maybe RSVP's... please wait to RSVP until you're 100%. And please don't flake this event is limited.

4) Please come on time, we are a group of well-mannered individuals who would like to eat together. ;)

5) Please update your RSVP with your dish the week of the event if not sooner.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[b]Q&amp;A:[/b]
[color=darkblue]Q) What do I do if I can't cook? Can I still come to enjoy everyone else's food?[/color]
A) Not to be an ass, but this isn't the event for you.

[color=darkblue]Q) How big a dish should I make?[/color]
A) Nothing too crazy... figure 12 people to be there, or there about. Also keep in mind you're not trying to fill anyone up with your dish. As there will be 11 other dishes! ;)

[color=darkblue]Q) I get off work at 11pm, can I come then?[/color]
A) Simple answer is no. But, I may make an exception if you have come to a previous tapa's party and proven yourself. ;)

[color=darkblue]Q) Do I need to bring silverware or plates?[/color]
A) No, I will provide plastic utensils and paper plate. 

[color=darkblue]Q) Can I bring a guest?[/color]
A) No, please have them register and sign-up themselves. Thanks!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[b]TAPA'S DEFINITION:[/b] 
ta·pa (tä'pä) n. - pl. ta·pas (-päs, -päz) 
Any of various small, savory Spanish dishes, often served as a snack or with other tapas as a meal.

[b]ADDITIONAL INFO:[/b]
Be sure to bring your personality; as stories, jokes, current events, and other conversations will be the true fare for the evening. As this event is focused on food, drinks and conversation your timely arrival will be greatly appreciated.

I've probably outlined req's for this event more than other events I've posted... but I want to make sure it's fun for everyone who participates.

Please don't let the requirements or the Q&amp;A discourage you if you haven't been to one of Fordee's Tapa's parties before ... they always fill up, and are always a blast... ask around!!!

I'll send out the address 2 days before the event to the yes rsvp's. I live on the Boca/Delray line.

Corteo, which means "cortege" in Italian, is a joyous procession, a festive parade imagined by a clown. The show brings together the passion of the actor with the grace and power of the acrobat to plunge the audience into a theatrical world of fun, comedy and spontaneity situated in a mysterious space between heaven and earth.  

The clown pictures his own funeral taking place in a carnival atmosphere, watched over by quietly caring angels. Juxtaposing the large with the small, the ridiculous with the tragic and the magic of perfection with the charm of imperfection, the show highlights the strength and fragility of the clown, as well as his wisdom and kindness, to illustrate the portion of humanity that is within each of us. The music, by turns lyrical and playful, carries Corteo through a timeless celebration in which illusion teases reality.  


More Information as we get closer to the venue.  

Guy Laliberté   
Guide and Founder   



Guy Laliberté was born in Quebec City in 1959. An accordion player, stiltwalker and fire-eater, this daring visionary founded Quebec's first internationally renowned circus. With the help of a small band of kindred spirits, Laliberté recognized and groomed the talents of the street entertainers from the Fête foraine de Baie-Saint-Paul and created Cirque du Soleil in 1984.  
   
Already a multitalented artist, Guy Laliberté quickly dove into the business world to plan and maintain the growth of the young company. Despite the group's lack of experience, he managed to convince financial institutions to back the project, winning them over with the originality and audacity of youth. He also developed a network of partners around the world to help Cirque du Soleil make a name for itself abroad.  
   
Guy Laliberté was the first to orchestrate the marriage of cultures and artistic and acrobatic disciplines that is the hallmark of Cirque du Soleil. Since 1984, he has guided the creative team through the creation of every show and contributed to elevating the circus arts to the level of the great artistic disciplines.   
   
Thanks to its founder's vision and talent for bringing people together, Cirque du Soleil has become an international organization, as much in terms of its makeup as in the scope of its activities and influence. Guy Laliberté now heads an organization with activities on five continents.  
   
In 2007, Guy Laliberté received the Ernst &amp;amp; Young Entrepreneur of the Year award for all three levels: Quebec, Canada and international. In 2004, he received the Order of Canada, the highest distinction in the country, from the Governor General of Canada.  The same year, he was recognized by Time Magazine as one of the 100 most influential people in the world. In 2003, he was honoured by the Condé Nast group as part of the Never Follow Program, a tribute to creators and innovators. In 2001, he was named a Great Montrealer by the Académie des Grands Montréalais. In 1997, Guy Laliberté received the Ordre National du Québec, the highest distinction awarded by the Government of Quebec</description><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/c/d/global_4834301.jpeg</photo_url><updated>Sat Jul 19 15:54:20 EDT 2008</updated><feedesc /><questions /><name>CIRQUE DU SOLEIL- CORTEO</name></item><item><lon>-80.23999786376953</lon><rsvpcount>0</rsvpcount><group_name>The Largest group in Florida; SFYA</group_name><lat>26.09000015258789</lat><feecurrency>USD</feecurrency><time>Sat Nov 15 00:00:00 EST 2008</time><ismeetup>0</ismeetup><event_url>http://nightlife.meetup.com/151/calendar/8585784</event_url><attendee_count>0</attendee_count><id>8585784</id><venue_lon /><fee>0.0</fee><venue_name /><venue_lat /><description /><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/5/a/global_3963418.jpeg</photo_url><updated>Wed Aug 20 15:41:32 EDT 2008</updated><feedesc /><questions /><name>november event 2</name></item><item><lon>-80.23999786376953</lon><rsvpcount>0</rsvpcount><group_name>The Largest group in Florida; SFYA</group_name><lat>26.09000015258789</lat><feecurrency>USD</feecurrency><time>Thu Nov 20 19:30:00 EST 2008</time><ismeetup>0</ismeetup><event_url>http://nightlife.meetup.com/151/calendar/8712971</event_url><attendee_count>0</attendee_count><id>8712971</id><venue_lon /><fee>0.0</fee><venue_name /><venue_lat /><description /><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/5/a/global_3963418.jpeg</photo_url><updated>Mon Sep 08 08:10:48 EDT 2008</updated><feedesc /><questions /><name>Icebreaker Dinner</name></item><item><lon>-80.23999786376953</lon><rsvpcount>0</rsvpcount><group_name>The Largest group in Florida; SFYA</group_name><lat>26.09000015258789</lat><feecurrency>USD</feecurrency><time>Fri Nov 21 00:00:00 EST 2008</time><ismeetup>0</ismeetup><event_url>http://nightlife.meetup.com/151/calendar/8585785</event_url><attendee_count>0</attendee_count><id>8585785</id><venue_lon /><fee>0.0</fee><venue_name /><venue_lat /><description /><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/5/a/global_3963418.jpeg</photo_url><updated>Wed Aug 20 15:41:40 EDT 2008</updated><feedesc /><questions /><name>november event 3</name></item><item><lon>-80.23999786376953</lon><rsvpcount>4</rsvpcount><group_name>The Largest group in Florida; SFYA</group_name><lat>26.09000015258789</lat><feecurrency>USD</feecurrency><time>Thu Nov 27 12:00:00 EST 2008</time><ismeetup>1</ismeetup><event_url>http://nightlife.meetup.com/151/calendar/8899417</event_url><attendee_count>0</attendee_count><id>8899417</id><venue_lon /><fee>0.0</fee><venue_name /><venue_lat /><description>[img]http://www.logosportswear.com/embroideryclipart/Thanksgiving%20Turkey.CD101706KS.jpg[/img]
