How about joining me to go see [url=http://www.reverendhortonheat.com/]Reverend Horton Heat[/url]?  They are a great punkabilly band.

"Undeniably, The Reverend Horton Heat, aka Jim Heath, is the biggest, baddest, grittiest, greasiest, greatest rocker that ever piled his hair up and pounded the drinks down...It's been an almost 20-year journey for Heath, whose country-flavored punkabilly and onstage antics have brought him and his band a strikingly diverse fan base and a devoted cult following, not to mention the respect of fellow musicians worldwide."

Tickets are $25.

A well driller unearths a strange substance that changes the lives of everyone in the small town of Montverde. Townsfolk are unaware as they are exposed to the primordial virus. The illness alters each victim's deepest instincts for survival and reverses their sense of pain and pleasure. Fear takes hold as love becomes hate with bloody consequences. As university researchers fall ill an opportunity for profiteers brings more danger to the small town. A handful of survivors must fight more than just the disease to stay alive.

The first time Jozef Lenders was handed a movie camera as a youngster he knew his future was in film. Born in the Netherlands, Jozef immigrated to America with his parents, learning English and becoming a US Citizen as a child. An avid photographer and filmmaker as a teen, he studied broadcasting in college. After several years in radio and working with the music industry, he founded his first video and film production company in 1984. Today Joe is a successful filmmaker, his work spans thousands of TV commercials and hundreds of television programs. “Terror Inside” is his directorial debut in feature films.

An After Film Party follows at Automatic Slims, FREE drink with ticket

By all appearances, Sam and Mason are the picture perfect couple: young, attractive, successful and madly in love. At her sister's idyllic spring wedding, Sam finds herself irresistibly drawn back into the arms of her dashing ex-boyfriend. Meanwhile, Mason barely thwarts the flirtatious advances of his best friend's 18 year-old sister. But when Sam confesses her affair, Mason's reaction is not quite what you would expect. So begins "Fling", a lively, sexy and provocative exploration of young adults navigating the hazards of an open relationship.
