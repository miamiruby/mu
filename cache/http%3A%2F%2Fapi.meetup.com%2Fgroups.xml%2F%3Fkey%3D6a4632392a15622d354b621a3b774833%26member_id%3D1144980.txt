Think you'll go deaf from the loud club music? Not that much of a drinker, but enjoy a few from time-to-time?  How about an open mic night, Karaoke, or a piano bar?

Early technology adopter?  We're the people you can brag to.

Know a local artist or performer?  We support our local artists.

No one gets your movie and tv references?  We will.

Like going to midnight movies on opening night.  Just say the word and we'll join you.
Art museums?  We may not know the history, but we can appreciate what we see.

Don't like to dance?  How about Dance Dance Revolution at Dave and Busters?
Want to learn to dance?  We'll get you lessons.

Curious how things work?  Off to the Museum of Science and Discovery.

DVD collection been replaced by a home media server?  Host an event to show it off.

Own at least ONE video game system?  Bring it over.

Miss the 80s?  Two words: LASER TAG

Role-playing? Hookups? Try a different group.

If you fall into any of those categories, then you might be a closet Geek with Social Skills and you'll be among friends here.

We have two purposes: (1) to provide an informal social setting for networking among web designers, web developers, programmers, and graphic designers; and (2) to provide an outlet for continuing education in the constantly changing field of web design, through member-conducted tutorials.

Each month we hold a seminar (how-to tutorial), a social networking meeting, and a General Membership meeting. Want to know more? Read our "About Us" page!

Discuss web design and development with others in South Florida. Great networking, skill-development, and social activity.
