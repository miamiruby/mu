Please join us for this WordPress Meet-up Kickoff, everyone is invited no matter your connection to WordPRess, developers, marketers, writers and bloggers will all find something of value tonight..

This will be the first of many meetings focusing on the worlds most popular blog platform; Wordpress.   Tonights meeting will be a chance for everyone to meet each other and get an idea of who does what. To help this along I created a short little optional poll to do when you sign up for this meeting. 

Additionally, I will be doing a basic presentation on "Using Wordpress as a Content Management System". Discussing how to move beyond just a blog and have full featured site powered by WordPress. This includes Lead Gen, Content publishing, eCommerce and much more ...

Look forward to seeing everyone.</description><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/8/d/global_5803421.jpeg</photo_url><updated>Thu Oct 09 07:31:44 EDT 2008</updated><feedesc /><questions /><name>SF WordPress Users Inagural Meetup and "WordPress as a CMS"</name></item></items></results>
